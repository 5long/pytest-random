pytest-random
=============

randomize your py.test run

The randomization algorithm is not the least bit sophisticated, so do not depend on this plugin for a specific degree of randomness. Please use the --verbose option to see the randomization for yourself.

usage:
    py.test . --random


Please note that there is no way to repeat any given test run.
